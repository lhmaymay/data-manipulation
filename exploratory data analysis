#Spotting mistakes and missing data;
#Mapping out the underlying structure of the data;
#Identifying the most important variables;
#Listing anomalies and outliers;
#Testing a hypotheses / checking assumptions related to a specific model;
#Establishing a parsimonious model (one that can be used to explain the data with minimal predictor variables);
#Estimating parameters and figuring out the associated confidence intervals or margins of error.



# 1: Univariate visualization — provides summary statistics for each field in the raw data set
# 2: Bivariate visualization — is performed to find the relationship between each variable in the dataset and the target variable of interest
# check correlations between features
# check correlations with target variable

# 3: Multivariate visualization — is performed to understand interactions between different fields in the dataset
# 4: Dimensionality reduction — helps to understand the fields in the data that account for the most variance between observations and allow for the processing of a reduced volume of data.
# help you to create graphical displays of high-dimensional data containing many variables;


#5: Multivariate visualizations, for mapping and understanding interactions between different fields in the data;
#6: K-Means Clustering (creating “centres” for each cluster, based on the nearest mean);
#7: Predictive models, e.g. linear regression.
