# 1: Univariate visualization — provides summary statistics for each field in the raw data set
# 2: Bivariate visualization — is performed to find the relationship between each variable in the dataset and the target variable of interest
# check correlations between features
# check correlations with target variable

# 3: Multivariate visualization — is performed to understand interactions between different fields in the dataset
# 4: Dimensionality reduction — helps to understand the fields in the data that account for the most variance between observations and allow for the processing of a reduced volume of data.
